# Pacman AI Projects

This repository showcases various experiments and implementations from my coursework including classic AI algorithms, game-playing agents, and more. Each project is contained within its own directory with specific instructions and details for running and understanding the code.

## Projects

### 1. **Project_01 and Project_02 - Pacman AI search Agents**
   In this project, I implemented a variety of agents to play the Pacman game, focusing on search algorithms such as A* search, adversarial search, and reinforcement learning using Q-learning. 

### 3. **Project_03 - Reinforcement Learning Agents**
   This project implementats Q-learning and Value Iteration algorithms, which are used to solve decision-making problems in environments such as grid worlds and Pacman. The goal is to develop intelligent agents capable of learning optimal policies through reinforcement learning techniques.

### 4. **Project_04 - Busters Beliefs AI Agents**
   This project implements agents that track and display beliefs about ghost positions in the Pacman game. It includes a greedy agent that charges the closest ghost and a keyboard-controlled agent for manual interaction.
